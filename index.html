        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Thomas but you can call me Tommy. I am a senior CIS major at Towson University. I 
            transferred from Harford Community College in the fall of 2022. I enjoy playing and watching
            almost all sports. I am a big Steelers fan, but do not worry I like the Orioles. I have been
            outisde the country 3 times which includes; Canada, Mexico and Australia. I currently work at
            Geek Squad as an Advanced Repair Agent. I have been in that role almost 2 years now and have
            worked for Best Buy as a whole almost 4 years. I love doing front end web developement as well as 
            system analysis type of work. I look forward to graduating in the spring and taking the next steps of life.
